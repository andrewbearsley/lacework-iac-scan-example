# Lacework IAC Scan Example

This project is an example of Infrastructure as Code (IAC) security scanning with Lacework. It contains Terraform configurations with intentional security issues that can be detected by Lacework's IAC scanner.

## Security Issues Included

The example Terraform code in the `example-terraform` directory contains numerous security issues across different AWS services, including:

### Storage & Data
- Unencrypted S3 buckets with public access
- Unencrypted databases (RDS, DynamoDB, Redshift, Neptune)
- Publicly accessible databases
- Unencrypted EBS volumes
- Elasticsearch domains without encryption or proper access controls
- SQS queues without encryption

### Networking & Compute
- Overly permissive security groups (0.0.0.0/0)
- EC2 instances with public IPs and unencrypted storage
- Load balancers using HTTP instead of HTTPS
- API Gateways without proper logging or encryption
- VPCs with insecure configurations

### Identity & Access Management
- IAM policies with wildcard permissions
- Weak password policies
- IAM users with console access but no MFA
- Access keys for IAM users
- Lambda functions with excessive permissions

### Logging & Monitoring
- CloudTrail without encryption or log validation
- Disabled GuardDuty
- Disabled Config recorder

## Usage
```bash
# Lacework CLI setup
lacework configure

# List installed components
lacework component list

# Install IAC component
lacework component install iac

# Update IAC component
lacework component update iac

# Scan the current directory
lacework iac scan
```
